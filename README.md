# Overhead Tank Intelligent Water Level Controller
This project uses only 3 sensing elements. You have to dip 3 wires in water tank at unequal levels. The wire from pin A1 is kept at top level of the tank. Then the wire from pin A0 is kept at the bottom level of the tank. And the third wire is dipped throughout down to the bottom of the tank.<br>

## Brief Details
This code was developed by me for Vidyasagar Academy students, www.vsa.edu.in<br>
License: You can use it for any purpose as long as you don't claim that you are the author of this program and you don't alter License terms and formulations (as given in the code at lines 1-10 of this .ino file).<br>

## Important Note
Refer the circuit of this project, before using this code.<br>
The analog input pins (A0 & A1) must be returned to ground via 100k resistor each. Refer circuit diagram.<br>
Then apply the water level signal to these two pins: Full or Empty<br>
